 * The project included in this repository is a banking app. This app helps to calculate varying interest rates for different scenerios. This is beneficial because it can help others to know how much to contrubute to add to their savings to maximize interest. 
 * One thing could have enhanced this project would be to modularize it. This would allow for more clarity and for better editing in the future.
 * This project is able to help for the real world because it shows critical thinking skills and a practical application for varying programing languages, such as C++.
 * This program is written using basic and non-complex code so that more people will be able to understand it and is also written using industry standards. This also would allow for co-workers to better pick up where I left off, if this was in the workplace.
